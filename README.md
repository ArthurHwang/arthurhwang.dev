### Motivation

arthurhwang.dev is my personal portfolio application I built to showcase my projects as well as my personal [blog](https://arthurhwang.dev/blog) where I attempt to write articles to explain technical topics in a not so technical way, in hopes that maybe readers in the future who browse my blog can have an "AH-HA" moment.

The blog was implemented by querying Contentful API to dynamically build server-side rendered pages.

Aside from showcasing my projects, I mainly built the project to learn about Apollo and GraphQL, which I used to build a real time GitHub commit CI / CD status component that queries and pulls commit data from GitHub API.

Next.js and styled components were used to build the fully responsive React application with form sanitation and validation done with Formik and Yup. I configured a custom SMTP proxy mailserver with MailGun so that I can receive and respond to emails as my hosted zone domain using my personal Gmail account.
